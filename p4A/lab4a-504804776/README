Tarbell contents:

my_beaglebone.jpg 
File is a selfie of me holding my Beaglebone :-)

connected.png 
File is a screenshot showing that I renamed my BB and configured network access. I used a mobile hotspot as my WiFi network instead of eduroam due to connectivity issues; the inet address in `wlan0` reflects this change.

copy.png
File is a screenshot from a local session where I scp a “Hello, World!” program from my laptop/desktop to my BB.
